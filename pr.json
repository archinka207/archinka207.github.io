        " Remember what he has suffered and consider his emotions on the morning after the production when he sees lines which he invented at the cost of permanently straining his brain, attributed by the critics to the impromptu invention of the leading comedian",
        "The musical comedy lyric is an interesting survival of the days, long since departed, when poets worked",
        " And\u2014mark the brutality of the thing\u2014there is no word you can substitute for \u201clove",
        " If every audience to which a musical comedy is destined to play were a metropolitan audience, all might be well; but there is the \u201croad\u201d to consider",
        "In the first place, the success of The Wanderer proves that the day of the small and intimate production is over and that what the public wants is the large spectacle",

        "There were few discoveries among the dramatists",
        " Of the older playwrights, Barrie produced a new one and an ancient one, but the Shakespeare boom, so strong last year, petered out",
        " There seems no doubt that the man, in spite of a flashy start, had not the stuff",
        " Somerset Maugham succeeded in shocking Broadway so that the sidewalks were filled with blushing ticket-speculators",
        " If it were not for the fact that nearly all the plays I praised died before my review appeared, while the ones I said would not run a week are still packing them in, I could look back to a flawless season",
        " I was particularly fortunate in having neighbors at most of the plays who were not afflicted with coughs or a desire to explain the plot to their wives",
        "Since Earth was first created, Since Time began to fly, No friends were e\u2019er so mated, So firm as JONES and I",
        "\u201cThen, JONES,\u201d I answered, sobbing, \u201cMy wooing\u2019s at an end, I couldn\u2019t think of robbing My best, my only friend",
        " I should be interested To hear her private views",
        "\u201cPerhaps she has a preference\u2014 I own it sounds absurd\u2014 But I submit, with deference, That she might well be heard",
        " But here is a spook of another stamp, No thin, theatrical sham, But a spectre who fears not dirt nor damp: He rides on a London tram",
        "The gathering shadows of night fall fast; The lamps in the street are lit; To the roof have the eerie footsteps passed, Where the outside passengers sit",
        " Ay, all unseen by your seat he\u2019ll stand, And (unless it\u2019s a wig) your hair Will rise at the touch of his icy hand, And the sound of his whispered \u201cFare",
        "\u201cWell, if he does it again, you\u2019ll find that there will be a few more bones buried in the garden",
        "Sylvia loved the dog partly for its own sake, but principally for that of the giver, one Reginald Dallas, whom it had struck at an early period of their acquaintance that he and Miss Sylvia Reynolds were made for one another",
        " On communicating this discovery to Sylvia herself he had found that her views upon the subject were identical with his own; and all would have gone well had it not been for a melancholy accident",
        " Reginald Dallas he did not have a fit, but merely signified in fairly moderate terms his entire and absolute refusal to think of such a thing",
        "It was generally felt that the way to find favour in the eyes of Sylvia\u2014which were a charming blue, and well worth finding favour in\u2014was to show an intelligent and affectionate interest in her dog",
        "However, they persevered, and scarcely a week went by in which Thomas was not rescued from an artfully arranged horrible fate by somebody",
        "But all their energy was in reality wasted, for Sylvia remembered her faithful Reggie, who corresponded vigorously every day, and refused to be put off with worthless imitations",
        " There was a yelp; then silence",
        " By noon it was public property; and in the afternoon, at various times from two to five, nineteen young men were struck, quite independently of one another, with a brilliant idea",
        "The results of this idea were apparent on the following day",

        "\u201cA hamper, is there",
        "\u201cIf you please, sir, there\u2019s several of them",
        " How many are there",
        " Where are they",
        " And if you please, sir, cook says she thinks there\u2019s something alive in them",
        "The colonel uttered a sound that was almost a bark, and, followed by Sylvia, rushed to the coachhouse",
        " There, sure enough, as far as the eye could reach, were the hampers; and, as they looked, a sound proceeded from one of them that was unmistakably the plaintive note of a dog that has been shut up, and is getting tired of it",
        " Sylvia continued her work of mercy, and by the time the colonel had recovered sufficiently to be able to express his views in English, eighteen more pugs had joined their companion",
        "\u201cWhere\u2019s my gun",
        "\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s something to show",

        "\u201cI expect there\u2019s one in each of the hampers",
        " Yes; here\u2019s another",
        " But while there is no law to prevent a lot of dashed young puppies like yourself, sir\u2014like yourself\u2014sending your confounded pug-dogs to my daughter, who ought to have known better than to have let them out of their dashed hampers, I have no defence",
        " Unless those dogs are removed by this time tomorrow, sir, they will go straight to the Battersea Home, where I devoutly trust they will poison them",
        " Here are the cards of the other gentlemen who were kind enough to think that I might wish to set up for a dog-fancier in my old age",
        " He\u2019s the furthest from being a fool of any of the young puppies who live about here, and he knows one end of a gun from the other",
        "This story will interest and amuse all cricketers, and while from the male point of view it may serve as a good illustration of the fickleness of woman and the impossibility of forecasting what course she will take, the fair sex will find in it an equally shining proof of the colossal vanity of man",

        " We both seem to have come here and let ourselves in for this rotten little village match, on a wicket which will probably be all holes and hillocks, simply for Dolly\u2019s sake",
        "\u201cIt\u2019ll give an interest to a rotten match,\u201d said Dick",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s one objection",
        " Whereas you, going in first, will have time for a decent knock before the rot starts",
        "\u201cLook here, Drew,\u201d said Dick; \u201cyou\u2019ll regard what I\u2019m going to say as said under seal of the confessional and that sort of thing, won\u2019t you",
        "There are two sorts of country cricket",
        " There is the variety you get at a country-house, where the wicket is prepared with a care as meticulous as that in fashion on any county ground; where red marl and such-like aids to smoothness have been injected into the turf all through the winter; and where the out-fielding is good and the boundaries spacious",
        " And there is the village match, where cows are apt to stroll on to the pitch before the innings and cover-point stands up to his neck in a furze-bush",
        " The team consisted of certain horny-handed sons of toil, with terrific golf-shots in the direction of square-leg, and the enemy\u2019s ranks were composed of the same material",
        " And yet\u2014there was the umpire with his hand raised, as if he were the Pope bestowing a blessing",
        " Why, I could hear the click from where I was sitting",
        "\u201cIf there is one",
        "\u201cOh, there\u2019ll be a second innings all right",
        " There\u2019s another man out",
        " The demon bowler of the enemy, having been f&#281;ted considerably under the trees by enthusiastic admirers during the innings of his side, was a little incoherent in his deliveries",
        " By the end of the third over the scores were level",
        "Enthusiasm ran high amongst the spectators, or such of them as were natives of the village",
        "\u201cBut, look here\u2013-\u201d said Dick",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re in precisely the same hole as we were before,\u201d said Dick",

        " I was spending a week or so there, as I generally did in the summer; and I had had to break my visit to come back to London to get a new valet",
        " It transpiring, moreover, that he had looted a lot of other things here and there about the place, I was reluctantly compelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten and go to London to ask the registry office to dig up another specimen for my approval",
        "Then he seemed to flicker, and wasn\u2019t there any longer",
        " The sun shone in through the window; birds twittered in the tree-tops; and, generally speaking, hope dawned once more",
        " I tendered my resignation because I could not see eye to eye with his lordship in his desire to dine in dress trousers, a flannel shirt, and a shooting coat",
        " If there was a flaw, so to speak, in the pure joy of being engaged to Florence, it was the fact that she rather took after her father, and one was never certain when she might erupt",
        "You know, there was a kind of rummy something about his manner",
        "At this point in the proceedings there was another ring at the front door",
        " Jeeves shimmered out and came back with a telegram",
        " It was perhaps rather sudden till you got used to it, but, nevertheless, an extremely sound effort, which many lads at the club and elsewhere had admired unrestrainedly",
        "Again there was that kind of rummy something in his manner",
        "I felt as if I had stepped on the place where the last stair ought to have been, but wasn\u2019t",
        " I felt defiant, if you know what I mean, and there didn\u2019t seem anything to defy",
        " Easeby wasn\u2019t one of those country houses you read about in the society novels, where young girls are lured on to play baccarat and then skinned to the bone of their jewellery, and so on",
        " Apparently there was a dance on at a house about twenty miles away that night, and she was motoring over with some of the Easeby lot and would be away some nights",
        " And though I knew he wouldn\u2019t have any objection to Florence, having known her father since they were at Oxford together, I hadn\u2019t wanted to take any chances; so I had told her to make an effort to fascinate the old boy",
        "\u201cBut, dash it, the family weren\u2019t so bad as all that",
        " The moment we began to read he plunged straight into a most scandalous story of how he and my father were thrown out of a music-hall in 1887",
        " There is a dreadful one about Lord Emsworth",
        " It is full of stories about people one knows who are the essence of propriety today, but who seem to have behaved, when they were in London in the \u2018eighties, in a manner that would not have been tolerated in the fo\u2019c\u2019sle of a whaler",
        " There is a story about Sir Stanley Gervase-Gervase at Rosherville Gardens which is ghastly in its perfection of detail",
        " They published Lady Carnaby\u2019s \u2018Memories of Eighty Interesting Years",
        " As a matter of fact, talking of Recollections and Memories, it was young blighted Edwin who, nine years before, had led his father to where I was smoking his cigar and caused all of the unpleasantness",
        "And then I tottered forth to think it over",
        "I\u2019ve often wondered since then how these murderer fellows manage to keep in shape while they\u2019re contemplating their next effort",
        "\u201cWhat are you doing here",
        " I was in here, looking round",
        " Berkeley had this room while you were away",
        " I didn\u2019t want to murder the kid, and yet there didn\u2019t seem any other way of shifting him",

        "He seemed a bit doubtful; but he staggered",
        " I shoved the parcel into a drawer, locked it, trousered the key, and felt better",
        " I might be a chump, but, dash it, I could out-general a mere kid with a face like a ferret",
        " Towards the end of the day the mere sight of the drawer began to depress me",
        " I found myself getting all on edge; and once when Uncle Willoughby trickled silently into the smoking-room when I was alone there and spoke to me before I knew he was there, I broke the record for the sitting high jump",
        " I therefore telephoned to Messrs",
        " To my consternation they informed me that they were not yet in receipt of my manuscript",
        " But here is a sinister thing",
        " I have spoken to Oakshott, who took the rest of the letters to the post office, and he cannot recall seeing it there",
        " He is, indeed, unswerving in his assertions that when he went to the hall to collect the letters there was no parcel among them",
        " It is a peculiarity of kleptomania, as you are no doubt aware, that the subject is unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of objects",
        "\u201cBut, uncle, one moment; I know all about those things that were stolen",
        "\u201cBut he isn\u2019t here",
        " Uncle Willoughby pottered about the room, registering baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette, feeling rather like a chappie I\u2019d once read about in a book, who murdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table, and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all the time",
        " The sun was sinking over the hills and the gnats were fooling about all over the place, and everything smelled rather topping\u2014what with the falling dew and so on\u2014and I was just beginning to feel a little soothed by the peace of it all when suddenly I heard my name spoken",
        "I had often wondered how those Johnnies in books did it\u2014I mean the fellows with whom it was the work of a moment to do about a dozen things that ought to have taken them about ten minutes",
        " But, as a matter of fact, it was the work of a moment with me to chuck away my cigarette, swear a bit, leap about ten yards, dive into a bush that stood near the library window, and stand there with my ears flapping",
        " I was as certain as I\u2019ve ever been of anything that all sorts of rotten things were in the offing",
        "\u201cIt sounds incredible,\u201d said Uncle Willoughby, thereby bucking me up a trifle",
        " \u201cI\u2019m sure the parcel\u2019s there",
        " Berkeley wired that he had left something here",
        " Things were getting too hot",
        " I sprinted up to my room and made for the drawer where I had put the parcel",
        "Where the dickens were my evening things",
        " I had looked all over the place before I remembered that Jeeves must have taken them away to brush",
        " I had just rung it when there was a footstep outside, and in came Uncle Willoughby",
        " I cannot find it downstairs; and it has, therefore, occurred to me that he may have left it in this room",
        "It was one of the most disgusting spectacles I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014this white-haired old man, who should have been thinking of the hereafter, standing there lying like an actor",
        "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it anywhere,\u201d I said",
        "\u201cI should have seen it if it had been here\u2014what",
        " I just stood there, losing weight every moment",
        "Then he came to the drawer where the parcel was",
        " He had shimmered in, carrying my evening things, and was standing there holding out the key",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d said Uncle Willoughby, \u201cthere is nothing here",
        "\u201cDid you\u2014Was there\u2014Have you by chance\u2013-\u201c",
        "\u201cI considered it more prudent, sir",
        "\u201cWell\u2014er\u2014Jeeves, I think that, on the whole, if you were to\u2014as it were\u2014freeze on to that parcel until we get back to London\u2013-\u201c",
        "\u201cAnd then we might\u2014er\u2014so to speak\u2014chuck it away somewhere\u2014what",
        " I didn\u2019t see her till we were all having tea in the hall",
        " Uncle Willoughby meandered back to the library, and there was a silence that you could have dug bits out of with a spoon",
        " There was a time when I thought that, with patience, you might be moulded into something worth while",
        " I think that both you and Lady Florence overestimated the danger of people being offended at being mentioned in Sir Willoughby\u2019s Recollections",
        " Her pride at seeing her photograph in the daily papers in connection with descriptions of her lower limbs before taking, which were nothing less than revolting, was so intense that it led me to believe that publicity, of whatever sort, is what nearly everybody desires",
        " Moreover, if you have ever studied psychology, sir, you will know that respectable old gentlemen are by no means averse to having it advertised that they were extremely wild in their youth",
        " In my opinion you and Lady Florence were quite unsuitably matched",
        " And I have it from her ladyship\u2019s own maid, who happened to overhear a conversation between her ladyship and one of the gentlemen staying here\u2014Mr",
        "It\u2019s rummy how sleeping on a thing often makes you feel quite different about it",
        " It was a perfectly topping day, and there was something about the way the sun came in at the window and the row the birds were kicking up in the ivy that made me half wonder whether Jeeves wasn\u2019t right",
        " Wasn\u2019t there something in what Jeeves had said about her character",
        " I began to realise that my ideal wife was something quite different, something a lot more clinging and drooping and prattling, and what not",
        " I can\u2019t put my hand on the passage, but you\u2019ll find it in Shakespeare or somewhere, I\u2019m pretty certain",
        " You see, they have early breakfast, and besides that there\u2019s a frightful risk of music after dinner",
        "\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure Roderick\u2019s going to be there this time",
        " She\u2019ll see from your lines that you are thinking of making a journey, and she\u2019ll either tell you to get a move on, which will mean that Roderick will be there, or else to keep away because she sees disaster",
        " Originally there was old man Craye, Duggie\u2019s father, who made a fortune out of the Soup Trust; Duggie\u2019s elder brother Edwin; Florence; and Duggie",
        " Next day they got a letter from him, saying that he was off to Europe, never to return, and that all communications were to be addressed to his lawyers",
        " There was no sign of the aunt when I called\u2014she had probably climbed a tree and pulled it up after her\u2014but Florence was there",
        " There was going to be no personal interview with sister, if he had to dodge about America like a snipe",
        " He would have to go there sooner or later",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I should do if I were you,\u201d I said",
        " \u201cI\u2019m not sure I didn\u2019t read some book or see some play somewhere or other where they tried it on, and it worked all right",
        " He was looking happy, but puzzled, like a man who has found a dime on the street and is wondering if there\u2019s a string tied to it",
        " I feel as if I\u2019d trodden on the last step when it wasn\u2019t there",
        " I believe there\u2019s a catch somewhere",
        "\u201cThere is, Dug,\u201d I said, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you what it is",
        " From the very start there was only one possible end to the thing",
        " She hardly spoke a word till we were on our way home",
        " He thought he could carry me off, but he finds he overestimated his powers",
        " He has remembered that he is a Craye",
        " She seemed to have cheered up a whole lot",
        "I went back to New York directly afterward, and I hadn\u2019t been there much more than a week when a most remarkably queer thing happened",
        "\u201cWhat are you doing here",
        " The difference is subtle but well marked",
        "It struck me that there was another difference that was subtle but well marked, and that was the difference between the Edwin I\u2019d left messing about over his family history a week before and the jovial rounder who was blowing smoke in my face now",
        " What\u2019s the matter with having a cross-talk team and a few performing dogs there",
        " I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a place somewhere in this city, if you can only find it, expressly designed for supplying first-aid to the fatigued",
        " It\u2019s hard to make you see the remarkableness of the whole thing, for, of course, if you look at it, in one way, there\u2019s nothing so record-breaking in smoking a cigar and drinking a highball",
        " There are degrees in everything, don\u2019t you know",
        " I think the whole fearful family had got on my nerves to such an extent that the mere sight of any of them made me jumpy",
        "The mere idea of Madison Avenue was beginning to give me that tired feeling, and I made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t go near the place",
        "Florence was there as before",
        " He sent an incoherent telegram",
        " They were obviously on their way to some theatre",
        "There was no doubt that Edwin had effected a thorough bolt",
        "\u201cWell, as a matter of fact, I did come to see if I could find out how things were running",
        " You must notice the difference",
        "\u201cThere is a difference",
        "\u201cNo, but see here,\u201d I said, \u201care you going to marry him",
        "\u201cOh, if I were a man",
        " If I were a man I could go in and find him\u2013-\u201c",
        "\u201cNot if you weren\u2019t a member,\u201d I said",
        "\u201cThen there\u2019s only one thing to do",
        "It was the same club where Edwin was hiding from Florence",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to butt in after all,\u201d I said",
        " \u201cHe\u2019ll meet Edwin there, and they can fight it out in the smoking room",
        " I used to go there to lunch with my uncle, the one who left me his money, and I always hated the place",
        "I\u2019m bound to say, though, there wasn\u2019t much hushed whispering when I started my interview with old man Craye",
        "All this vaudeville team business, mind you, as if we were bellowing at each other across the street",

        " He differs from the absolute slacker in that at rare intervals he actually turns up, changed withal into the garb of the game, and thirsting for the fray",
        " To begin with, he is forced by stress of ignorance to ask the newcomer his name",
        " The partial slacker, scorning to insert his head in the scrum, assumes a commanding position outside and from this point criticises the Game-Captain\u2019s decisions with severity and pith",
        " The warrior just back from the front had enquired after George Vanderpoop, and we, who knew that George\u2019s gentle spirit had, to use a metaphor after his own heart, long since been withdrawn from circulation, were feeling uncomfortable and wondering how to break the news",
        " All the rest he had obtained with the greatest ease",
        " I was with him when he made his first attempt on the Scrutinizer",
        " He had baited his hook with an essay on Evolution",
        " The Scrutinizer, which had been running for nearly a century without publishing a line of fiction, took it and asked for more",

        " The poem had been returned, but without a rejection form",
        " According to the usually well-informed Daily Lyre, all \u2018bombastic\u2019 advertising is punished with a fine",
        " In case this idea should be introduced into England, I have drawn up a few specimen advertisements which, in my opinion, combine attractiveness with a shrinking modesty at which no censor could cavil",
        " \u201cAttractive, I fancy, without being bombastic",
        "It sounded like an epigram, but epigrams are so little associated with Reggie that I ventured to ask what he meant",

        "It was then that I first made acquaintance with the awful power of ridicule",
        " They thought nothing of winding up an evening with a couple of egg-phosphates and a chocolate fudge",
        " I was intoxicated with sudden popularity",
        " The shining counter, the placards advertising strange mixtures with ice cream as their basis, the busy men behind the counter, the half-cynical, half-pitying eyes of the girl in the cage where you bought the soda checks",
        " I dug my spoon into it with an assumption of gaiety which I was far from feeling",
        " They were gulping their sundaes down with the speed and enjoyment of old hands",
        " I was too weak to dispense with my popularity",
        " I was only a boy, and on the previous evening the captain of the Checkers Club, to whom I looked up with an almost worshipping reverence, had slapped me on the back and told me that I was a corker",
        "\u201cDoctor,\u201d I said, covering my face with my hands, \u201cI am a confirmed soda-fiend",

        " Always with her divinely sympathetic encouragement, I gradually acquired a taste for alcohol",
        "This is peculiarly an age where novelists pride themselves on the breadth of their outlook and the courage with which they refuse to ignore the realities of life; and never before have authors had such scope in the matter of the selection of heroes",
        " The hero was a young lordling, sprung from a line of ancestors who had never done anything with their eyes except wear a piercing glance before which lesser men quailed",
        "Novelists are moving with the times in every other direction",
        " The growing tenseness of life, with its small print, its newspapers read by artificial light, and its flickering motion pictures, is whittling down the section of the populace which has perfect sight to a mere handful",

        " And then his glasses get all misty, and there he is, temporarily blind, with a full-size desperado backing away and measuring the distance in order to hand him one with a pickaxe",
        " But, if this warning should be neglected, if we have any more of these novels about men with keen gray eyes or snapping black eyes or cheerful blue eyes\u2014any sort of eyes, in fact, lacking some muscular affliction, we shall know what to do",
        " Above the eyebrows comes a stagnant sea of bald forehead, stretching away into the distance with nothing to relieve it but a few wisps of lonely hair",
        " The idea is that the public sees the photograph, pauses spell-bound for an instant, and then with a cry of ecstasy rushes off to the book-shop and buys copy after copy of the gargoyle\u2019s latest novel",
        " People read a review of an author\u2019s book and are told that it throbs with a passion so intense as almost to be painful, and are on the point of digging seven-and-sixpence out of their child\u2019s money-box to secure a copy, when their eyes fall on the man\u2019s photograph at the side of the review, and they find that he has a face like a rabbit and wears spectacles and a low collar",
        " And this man is the man who is said to have laid bare the soul of a woman as with a scalpel",
        " He had to stand up, backed by a rustic stile and a flabby canvas sheet covered with exotic trees, glaring straight into the camera",
        " To prevent any eleventh-hour retreat, a sort of spiky thing was shoved firmly into the back of his head leaving him with the choice of being taken as he stood or having an inch of steel jabbed into his skull",

        " Trouble begins with the third, a long dog-leg hole through the kitchen into the dining-room",
        " This hole is well trapped with table-legs, kitchen utensils, and a moving hazard in the person of Clarence the cat, who is generally wandering about the fairway",
        " They are without traps, the only danger being that you may lose a stroke through hitting the maid if she happens to be coming down the back stairs while you are taking a mashie-shot",
        " In the drawing-room the fairway is trapped with photograph frames\u2014with glass, complete\u2014these serving as casual water: and anyone who can hole out on the piano in five or under is a player of class",
        " But on that occasion he had the misfortune to be bunkered in a photograph of my Aunt Clara and took no fewer than eleven strokes with his niblick to extricate himself from it",
        " Once trapped there, it is better to give up the hole without further effort",
        " Poetry, like wine, certain brands of cheese, and public buildings, was rightly considered to improve with age; and no connoisseur could have dreamed of filling himself with raw, indigestible verse, warm from the maker",
        " Our children grow to adolescence with the feeling that they can become poets instead of working",

        "The trouble about musical comedy, and the reason why a great many otherwise kindly and broadminded persons lie in wait round the corner with sudden scowls, their whole being intent on beating it with a brick the moment it shows its head, is that, from outside, it looks too easy",
        " He is aware that both artistes, though extremely gifted northward as far as the ankle-bone, go all to pieces above that level, with the result that by the time you reach the zone where the brains and voice are located, there is nothing stirring whatever",
        " The unfolding of the plot he had left to the other characters, with a few ingenious gaps where the two stars could come on and dance",
        " \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing the matter with this piece,\u201d he says",

        " He has carelessly allowed fully twenty pages to pass without once bringing on the chorus",
        " When the time comes to cast the piece, he finds that the only possible man in sight wants fifteen hundred a week and, anyway, is signed up for the next five years with the rival syndicate",
        " He is then faced with the alternative of revising his play to suit either: a) Jones, who can sing and dance, but is not funny; b) Smith, who is funny, but cannot sing and dance; c) Brown, who is funny and can sing and dance, but who cannot carry a love-interest and, through working in revue, has developed a habit of wandering down to the footlights and chatting with the audience",
        " The original line is such that it cannot be simply switched from one to the other",
        " Multiply this by a hundred, and you will begin to understand why, when you see a librettist, he is generally lying on his back on the sidewalk with a crowd standing round, saying, \u201cGive him air",

        " He can put in \u201cNome,\u201d of course, as a pinch-hitter in special crises, but very seldom; with the result that his poetic soul, straining at its bonds, goes and uses \u201calone,\u201d \u201cbone,\u201d \u201ctone,\u201d and \u201cthrown,\u201d exciting hoots of derision",

        " Now, the colonel prided himself with justice on his powers as a shot; but on this particular day he had a touch of liver, which resulted in his shooting over the birds, and under the birds, and on each side of the birds, but very rarely at the birds",
        " And when, at the end of dinner, Sylvia came to him with the absurd request that she might marry Mr",
        "But all their energy was in reality wasted, for Sylvia remembered her faithful Reggie, who corresponded vigorously every day, and refused to be put off with worthless imitations",

        " The team consisted of certain horny-handed sons of toil, with terrific golf-shots in the direction of square-leg, and the enemy\u2019s ranks were composed of the same material",
        " Tom and Dick, in ordinary circumstances, would have gone in to bat in such a match with a feeling of lofty disdain, as befitting experts from the civilised world, come to teach the rustic mind what was what",

        " For a moment I felt as if somebody had touched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my throat with a lighted torch, and then everything seemed suddenly to get all right",
        " The sun shone in through the window; birds twittered in the tree-tops; and, generally speaking, hope dawned once more",
        "I perceived clearly that this cove was one of the world\u2019s wonders, the sort no home should be without",
        " I tendered my resignation because I could not see eye to eye with his lordship in his desire to dine in dress trousers, a flannel shirt, and a shooting coat",

        " He was always in a sort of fever because he was dropping behind schedule with his daily acts of kindness",
        " However hard he tried, he\u2019d fall behind; and then you would find him prowling about the house, setting such a clip to try and catch up with himself that Easeby was rapidly becoming a perfect hell for man and beast",

        " I had to call on Jeeves to rally round with one of those life-savers of his",

        " He will purloin an old coat as readily as a diamond ring, or a tobacco pipe costing but a few shillings with the same eagerness as a purse of gold",
        " Uncle Willoughby pottered about the room, registering baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette, feeling rather like a chappie I\u2019d once read about in a book, who murdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table, and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all the time",
        " The sun was sinking over the hills and the gnats were fooling about all over the place, and everything smelled rather topping\u2014what with the falling dew and so on\u2014and I was just beginning to feel a little soothed by the peace of it all when suddenly I heard my name spoken",

        " But, as a matter of fact, it was the work of a moment with me to chuck away my cigarette, swear a bit, leap about ten yards, dive into a bush that stood near the library window, and stand there with my ears flapping",
        " I was discussing the disappearance of my manuscript with Bertie only a moment back, and he professed himself as perplexed by the mystery as myself",
        "\u201cWell, I was in his room yesterday afternoon, doing him an act of kindness, and he came in with a parcel",
        " To leap at the bell and ring it was, with me, the work of a moment",
        "\u201cOh, Bertie,\u201d he said, without a blush, \u201cI have\u2014ah\u2014received a telegram from Berkeley, who occupied this room in your absence, asking me to forward him his\u2014er\u2014his cigarette-case, which, it would appear, he inadvertently omitted to take with him when he left the house",
